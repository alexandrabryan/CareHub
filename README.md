This project was created by Team 2 from MomsCan:Code Develop Camp, cohort 1. It is a collaborative web app built by a remote 
team of 4 moms-turned-coders as a result of a 3 week sprint project. 

We were presented with a fact ("The elderly will outnumber their children for the first time in US history.") and followed 
the design thinking process to eventually identify a problem with our target user, and prototype a solution to that problem. 
The design thinking steps involved doing initial research, creating a stakeholder map, empathizing with the user, data 
collection via suverys and interviews, defining a problem and ideating solutions. In about a week, we had gone from the fact 
above to a "big idea" to wireframe and prototype. Our pitch - "Our team of web developer moms is building a web app to help 
caregivers of aging family members easily build a support network with a single hub to communicate and coordinate care."

We then used Figma to create a low fidelity wireframe to outline the user experience and main functionality of the app, then 
got to work! The app was deployed via Heroku, and uses PostgreSQL as its database.
